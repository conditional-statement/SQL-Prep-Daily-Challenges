We want to see all movies that have more than 10 actors/actresses. Show the film_id, title, and number of actors for each film that meets this criteria.
```sql
SELECT 
     f.film_id
    ,f.title
    ,COUNT(*)
FROM film AS f
JOIN film_actor AS fa
    ON f.film_id = fa.film_id
GROUP BY 
     f.film_id
    ,f.title
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 10
```
