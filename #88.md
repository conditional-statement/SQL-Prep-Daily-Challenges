We want to see the country that has the highest population, and the one with the smallest population. Show the population rank (1 being the most populated), name, and population for these 2 countries.
```sql
WITH cte AS(
    SELECT
         name
        ,population
        ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY population DESC) AS rank
    FROM country
            )
            
SELECT *
FROM cte
WHERE 1=1 
    AND rank IN ((SELECT MIN(rank) FROM cte), (SELECT MAX(rank) FROM cte))
ORDER BY
    rank
```
