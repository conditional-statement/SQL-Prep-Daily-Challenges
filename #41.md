CHALLENGE: Using the WORLD database, show all the country information we have about the country with the highest life expectancy for each continent.
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY lifeexpectancy DESC) AS rn
        ,code
    FROM
        country
    )

SELECT *
FROM country
WHERE 1=1
    AND code in (SELECT code FROM cte WHERE rn = 1)
    AND continent  <> 'antarctica'
```
