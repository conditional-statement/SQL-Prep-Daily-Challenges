CHALLENGE: Using the WORLD database, we want to see the countries with the lowest population density. Display the name, density ranking, and population per surface area for the 10 countries with the lowest population density.
```sql
SELECT TOP 10
     name
    ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY (population/surfacearea) DESC) AS 'density'
    ,surfacearea/population
FROM
    country
WHERE 1=1
