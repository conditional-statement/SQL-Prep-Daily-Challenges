Create a report to know which employee is reporting to whom. Capitalize the entire first name of the person being reported to. For example â€“ "Mary reports to DIANE"
```sql
SELECT--DISTINCT
    CONCAT(e2.firstName, ' reports to ', UPPER(e1.firstName))
FROM employees AS e1
JOIN employees AS e2
    ON e1.employeeNumber = e2.reportsTo
```
