The check we sent out for the third highest amount has been misplaced! We want information about that check. Write a query to find third highest check amount and display customer name, check number, amount and payment date.
```sql
SELECT
     customerName
    ,checkNumber
    ,amount
    ,paymentDate
FROM(
    SELECT
         c.customerName
        ,p.checkNumber
        ,p.amount
        ,p.paymentDate
        ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY p.amount DESC) AS rn
    FROM customers AS c
        JOIN payments AS p
            ON p.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
    ) AS x
WHERE rn = 3
```
