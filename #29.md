CHALLENGE: We want a report of employees and orders that are still in the works (not shipped, cancelled, or resolved). Show the employee name (first and last), customer number, order number, and the status of the order.
```sql
SELECT
     e.firstname + ' ' + e.lastname AS 'employee_name'
    ,c.customernumber
    ,o.ordernumber
    ,o.status
FROM
    employees AS e
JOIN customers AS c
    ON c.salesrepemployeenumber = e.employeenumber
JOIN orders AS o
    ON o.customernumber = c.customernumber
WHERE 1=1
    AND status NOT IN ('shipped', 'cancelled', 'resolved')
```
