Show all orderdates with a time attached. Set the time to 8 AM (don't need to show AM though) for all of the orderdates.
```sql
DECLARE @time datetime
SET @time = '08:00:00'

SELECT CAST(orderDate AS datetime) + @time
FROM orders
```
```sql
SELECT DATEADD(hh, 8, CAST(orderdate AS datetime)) AS 'Order Date and Time'
FROM orders
```
