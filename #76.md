Write a query that will return all records from the employees table where there are no records in the contacts table for the matching columns contactlastname and contactfirstname. Hint: Use NOT Exist clause.
```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM employees AS e
WHERE NOT EXISTS(
                SELECT 1
                FROM customers AS c
                WHERE c.contactLastName = e.lastName
                    AND c.contactFirstName = e.firstName
                )
```
