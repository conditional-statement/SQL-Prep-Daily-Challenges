The company decided to give a bonus to the employees who work as sales representatives. Calculate a bonus that is 10% of the average amount paid by the respective customer for that sales representative. Display employees first name, customer name, total amount paid by that customer as “Amount”, and the bonus in a column named “10% Bonus”. You should have a row for each sales rep - customer relationship.
```sql
SELECT
     e.firstName
    ,c.customerName
    ,SUM(p.amount) AS 'Amount'
    --,(SUM(p.amount)/COUNT(p.amount))*.1 AS '10% Bonus'
    ,AVG(p.amount)*.1 AS '10% Bonus'
FROM employees AS e
JOIN customers AS c
    ON c.salesRepEmployeeNumber = e. employeeNumber
JOIN payments AS p
    ON p.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
GROUP BY
     e.firstName
    ,c.customerName
```
