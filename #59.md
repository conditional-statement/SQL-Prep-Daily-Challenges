We want to see orders that are in process. Display the product name, require date, shipped date and status of these orders. If there is no shipped date then it should display ‘Unavailable’.
```sql
SELECT
     p.productName
    ,o.requiredDate
    ,IIF(o.shippedDate IS NULL, 'Unavailable', CAST(o.shippedDate AS Varchar(10))) AS 'shippeddate'
    ,status
FROM orderdetails AS od
JOIN products AS p
    ON od.productCode = p.productCode
JOIN orders AS o
    ON od.orderNumber = o.orderNumber
WHERE status = 'In Process'
```
