```sql
SELECT

FROM(
      SELECT
           DATEPART(year, o.shippedDate) AS 'year'
          ,od.quantityOrdered AS 'total'
      FROM orderdetails AS od
          JOIN orders AS o
              ON od.orderNumber = o.orderNumber
              AND o.status = 'shipped'
    ) AS s
PIVOT
(count(total)
FOR year in ([2003], [2004], [2005])) AS c
```
```sql
select
     count(case when year(o.shippeddate)=2003 then ord.productcode end) as "2003"
    ,count(case when year(o.shippeddate)=2004 then ord.productcode end) as "2004"
    ,count(case when year(o.shippeddate)=2005 then ord.productcode end) as "2005"
from orders o 
join orderdetails ord on o.ordernumber=ord.ordernumber 
where o.status='Shipped' 
    and year(o.shippeddate) is not null;
