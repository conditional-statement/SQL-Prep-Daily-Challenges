Show the 3 smallest and 3 largest payment_id numbers. So if the smallest 3 are 1, 2, and 3, and the largest are 55, 56, and 57, then show all of them in a series of rows in one column.
```sql
SELECT * FROM(
    SELECT TOP 3
        payment_id
    FROM payment
    ORDER BY payment_id) AS f
    
UNION ALL

SELECT * FROM(
    SELECT TOP 3
        payment_id
    FROM payment
    ORDER BY payment_id DESC) AS s
```
