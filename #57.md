Retailer Company wants to organize their customers into ‘Regular’, ‘Premium’, ‘Sliver’ and ‘Gold’ categories. Customers who paid an average amount between $1,000-$9,999 should be in the ‘Regular’ category. $10,000-$29,999 is ‘Premium’, $30,000-$39,999 is ‘Silver’, and $40,000 and above would be a gold customer. Design a query for this scenario, displaying customer name and their category. Order the category ‘Gold’ to ‘Regular’.
```sql
SELECT
    c.customername
    ,CASE
            WHEN sum(p.amount)/count(o.orderNumber) >= 40000 THEN 'Gold'
            WHEN sum(p.amount)/count(o.orderNumber) >= 30000 THEN 'Silver'
            WHEN sum(p.amount)/count(o.orderNumber) >= 10000 THEN 'Premium' 
            ELSE 'Regular'
    END AS 'category'
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o
    ON c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber
JOIN payments AS p
    ON c.customerNumber = p.customerNumber
GROUP BY
    c.customername
ORDER BY
    sum(p.amount)/count(o.orderNumber) DESC
```
