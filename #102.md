Calculate the number of products each supplier is responsible for. Output should include supplier ID, supplier company name and product count. Sort by product count (descending) and company name (alphabetic order).
```sql
SELECT
     s.supplierID
    ,s.companyName
    ,count(p.productID) AS 'productCount'
FROM suppliers AS s
JOIN products AS p
    ON s.supplierid = p.supplierid
GROUP BY
     s.supplierID
    ,s.companyName
ORDER BY
      productCount DESC
     ,s.companyName
```
