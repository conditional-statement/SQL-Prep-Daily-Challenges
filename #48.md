Find the total number of customers that each employee represents. Prepare a report in this format – "Andy Fixter represents 5 customers". Name the column “No. of customers” and order it by customer count ascending.
```sql
SELECT
    CONCAT  ( 
            e.firstName
            ,' '
            ,e.lastName
            ,' represents '
            ,COUNT(c.customerNumber)
            ,' customers.'
            ) AS 'No. of customers'
FROM employees AS e
    JOIN customers AS c
        ON e.employeeNumber = c.salesRepEmployeeNumber
GROUP BY
    e.firstName, e.lastName
ORDER BY 
    COUNT(c.customerNumber)
