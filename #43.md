CHALLENGE: Using the WORLD database, show all country information for the top 3 largest (area) countries per continent.
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        code
        ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY surfaceArea DESC) AS 'rn'
        ,continent
    FROM country
    )

SELECT
     cte.rn
    ,c.*
FROM country AS c
JOIN cte AS cte
    ON c.code = cte.code
        AND c.code IN (SELECT code FROM cte WHERE 1=1 AND rn <= 3)
```
```sql
WITH country_rank AS
    (
    SELECT
         RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY SurfaceArea DESC) AS ranking
        ,*
    FROM country
    )
    
SELECT
    *
FROM
    country_rank
WHERE
    ranking < 4
```
