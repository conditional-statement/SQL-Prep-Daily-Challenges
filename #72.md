Create a query which displays the total number of products shipped in the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 combined. Also have a column for each of those years with the total number of products shipped in each year respectively. Your results should display in the following format â€“ 
```
    Total   2003    2004    2005
        x      x       x	   x
```
```sql
WITH cte AS(
SELECT
     COUNT(od.quantityOrdered) AS 'q'
    ,YEAR(o.shippedDate) AS 'year'
FROM orderdetails AS od
JOIN orders AS o
    ON o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber
        AND o.status = 'shipped'
        AND YEAR(o.shippedDate) IN (2003, 2004, 2005)
GROUP BY
    YEAR(o.shippedDate)
)

SELECT TOP 1
    c1.q + c2.q + c3.q AS 'total'
    ,c1.q AS '2003'
    ,c2.q AS '2004'
    ,c3.q AS '2005'
FROM cte AS c
JOIN cte AS c1 ON c1.year = 2003
JOIN cte AS c2 ON c2.year = 2004
JOIN cte AS c3 ON c3.year = 2005
