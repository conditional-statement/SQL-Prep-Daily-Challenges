We want to see the amounts for some of our biggest payments. Show the amounts for the 5th to 10th largest payments, from highest to lowest.
```sql
SELECT
     ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY amount DESC) AS 'order'
    ,amount
FROM
    payments
ORDER BY
    amount DESC
OFFSET 4 ROWS FETCH NEXT 6 ROWS ONLY
```
